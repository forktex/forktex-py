"""Translate database constraint violations into typed ``AppError``s.

One implementation, replacing two that disagreed: ``crud.create`` mapped
*every* ``IntegrityError`` to ``ConflictError`` and leaked the raw driver
message into the user-facing error, while grid's own copy mapped
unique violations to ``AlreadyExistsError`` and everything else to
``BadRequestError`` with fixed messages.

Detection is by **SQLSTATE**, not by substring-matching the driver's message.
The old ``"unique" in str(exc).lower()`` test was locale- and driver-dependent;
the codes below are defined by the SQL standard and exposed by asyncpg.
