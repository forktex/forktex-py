"""One pagination shape, and the keyset machinery behind it.

Four incompatible shapes used to coexist: ``crud.PageResponse`` (offset, always
counted), ``crud.ScrollResponse`` (``limit+1``, and its ``next_cursor`` was
never populated — so it could not page past the first page), ``grid.Page``
(``rows``/``total``) and ``flow.InstancePage`` (``items``/``total``, and never
actually constructed). Field names collided three ways — ``data`` vs ``rows`` vs
``items``, ``total`` vs ``total_count`` — so nothing could be shared.

:class:`Page` is the single shape. The cursor design is grid's, because it was
the correct one: a **positional array** of the actual sort-key values plus a
tiebreaker, so it works for any sort. flow's cursor stored only
``{started_at, id}`` while its ``ORDER BY`` could be any of four columns, which
made the keyset predicate disagree with the ordering and skip or duplicate rows.

A malformed cursor raises ``BadRequestError`` rather than silently restarting
from page one — the caller asked for a specific position and should be told the
token is bad, not handed different data.
