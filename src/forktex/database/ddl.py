"""DDL as SQLAlchemy constructs, not hand-built SQL strings.

The library creates and alters real Postgres objects at runtime (grid's
promoted-column sidecars and payload indexes, flow's extension columns).
Historically that meant f-string SQL guarded by an identifier regex. This
module replaces it, because SQLAlchemy constructs are strictly better here:

- **Quoting is the dialect's job.** The compiler's ``IdentifierPreparer``
  escapes and quotes every name, so a hostile identifier renders as data
  rather than syntax. A regex guard can only *reject*; quoting is correct even
  for names the guard would have to allow.
- **They compile without a database.** ``str(stmt.compile(dialect=...))`` is a
  pure function of the construct, so DDL is unit-testable with no container —
  which is the whole point of moving off strings.
- **They respect ``schema_translate_map``.** f-string SQL had to interpolate
  the runtime schema by hand, which is precisely why those f-strings existed.

SQLAlchemy 2.0 already covers most of the surface natively, so this module
mostly re-exports it and adds only what Core genuinely lacks: ``ALTER TABLE …
ADD/DROP COLUMN``, for which there is no built-in construct.
