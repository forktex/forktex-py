"""Schema reflection via SQLAlchemy's ``Inspector``.

Three hand-written ``information_schema`` queries used to live in `grid` (twice)
and `flow` (once), each with a different signature and return shape, and one of
them ran a separate round-trip *per column*. SQLAlchemy already ships a
reflection API that is dialect-portable and maintained upstream, so this module
is a thin async adapter over it rather than more SQL.

Everything accepts either an ``AsyncSession`` or an ``AsyncConnection``, since
the former callers were split between the two.
