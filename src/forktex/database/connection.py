"""Async SQLAlchemy engine and session management for PostgreSQL.

Two ways in, one implementation:

- **:class:`Database`** — an explicit handle owning one engine + sessionmaker.
  Use it when a component needs its *own* pool, or several pools must coexist
  (e.g. a workflow engine holding one per instance, when two instances may
  run against different schemas in the same process).
- **module-level functions** — ``init_engine`` / ``get_session`` /
  ``session_scope`` / ``close_engine`` operate on a single default
  :class:`Database`. This is the convenient path for an application that only
  ever needs one pool, and it is what a FastAPI dependency uses.

Both paths share the same session semantics, so they cannot drift apart.

Usage:
    # Basic — default pool settings
    init_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db")

    # With pool tuning
    init_engine(
        "postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@host/db",
        pool_size=20,
        max_overflow=10,
        pool_pre_ping=True,
    )

    # FastAPI lifespan
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def lifespan(app):
        init_engine(settings.db_url)
        yield
        await close_engine()

    # Route handler — note session_scope, not get_session: a FastAPI
    # dependency must be a plain async generator, and get_session is the
    # asynccontextmanager-wrapped variant.
    async def my_route(session: AsyncSession = Depends(session_scope)):
        ...

    # Service layer — either the decorator...
    @with_transactional_session
    async def my_service(session: AsyncSession, ...):
        ...

    # ...or the context manager
    async with get_session() as session:
        ...

    # An owned pool, independent of the module-level default
    db = Database(url, schema_translate_map={"forktex_flow": "my_schema"})
    async with db.session() as session:
        ...
    await db.dispose()

    Three call shapes, all transactional:

      raise). Same as v1.x behaviour.
    - **Caller passes a session with NO active transaction.** The

      success.
    - **Caller passes a session WITH an active transaction.** The
      decorator opens a ``SAVEPOINT`` via ``session.begin_nested()``,
      commits the savepoint on success, rolls back on raise. The
      outer transaction still owns the actual commit-to-DB.

    This closes the v1-v3 footgun where callers passed a session and
    forgot to commit — silently rolling back the wrapped function's
    work at session close. v3's ``next_in_series`` gapless-invariant
    "bug" was a symptom of this; v3's ``bulk_insert_rows`` documented
    it as a caller responsibility. v4 fixes it at the source: every
    decorated function now always persists or always rolls back,
    atomically.
