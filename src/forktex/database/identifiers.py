"""SQL identifier validation — one implementation, explicit profiles.

Three near-copies of this used to exist (``database.migrate``,
``flow.migrations._runner``, and grid's own copy) with *incompatible*
policies: the first two accepted lower-case only with no length limit and
raised bare ``ValueError``; grid accepted mixed case, capped length at 128, and
raised ``BadRequestError``. Collapsing them onto a single rule would have
either loosened the migration-runner checks or broken grid's mixed-case column
keys, so the differences are expressed as **named profiles** instead.

Validation is defence in depth, not the primary defence: identifiers that
reach DDL should travel through SQLAlchemy constructs (see
``forktex.database.ddl``), where the dialect's preparer quotes them
correctly. These validators exist to reject nonsense early, with a clear
error, and to keep hostile input out of the few places a name is still
interpolated.
