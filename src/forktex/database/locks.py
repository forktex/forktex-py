"""Postgres advisory lock primitives.

Three patterns, in two scopes.

**Session-scoped** — held for the lifetime of a connection this module owns,
surviving ``COMMIT``/``ROLLBACK``. Both take an ``AsyncEngine`` because they
open their own connection:

1. ``advisory_lock`` — blocking. Used by the migration runner: every worker
   calls it, one proceeds, the rest wait.
2. ``try_advisory_lock`` — non-blocking, yields ``True``/``False``. Used for
   leader election: when the connection dies Postgres releases the lock
   automatically, which is what triggers failover.

**Transaction-scoped** — released by Postgres at transaction end, and takes the
caller's ``AsyncSession`` so it participates in *their* transaction:

3. ``xact_lock`` — for serialising work that is already inside a transaction.
   The engine-based helpers above cannot express this: they open a separate
   connection, so their lock has no relationship to the caller's transaction.
   Two call sites used to hand-roll this (one in Core, one in raw SQL) purely
   because it was missing here.

Keys are 64-bit signed integers. Derive them with :func:`advisory_key` rather
than by hand — it hashes deterministically in Python and folds into Postgres's
signed ``bigint`` range. Note it deliberately replaces one prior approach that
computed the key server-side with ``hashtext()``: that function's result is
**not stable across Postgres major versions**, so a cluster upgrade would
silently change which lock a caller takes.

Usage::

    from forktex.database.locks import advisory_key, advisory_lock, xact_lock

    # Migration-style: block until this process is the only one migrating
    async with advisory_lock(engine, advisory_key("myapp", "migrations")):
        await run_ddl()

    # Leader-election-style: non-blocking, hold for lifetime of block
    async with try_advisory_lock(engine, advisory_key("myapp", "driver-leader")) as is_leader:
        if is_leader:
            await run_leader_loop()

    # Inside an existing transaction, released at its end
    await xact_lock(session, advisory_key("namespace", ns))
