"""Level-0 ``[error]`` extra — AppError hierarchy + envelope + http mapping.

This module is the public, top-level home for the app exception
hierarchy that every forktex service raises and every transport
(HTTP, CLI, queue) translates::

    from forktex.error import AppError, NotFoundError, to_envelope

``AppError`` carries a ``code`` consumers switch on to build typed error
envelopes; it has no notion of HTTP or any other transport. A FastAPI
exception handler owns its own ``AppErrorCode`` → HTTP-status mapping,
since HTTP is the one transport that needs one. The envelope shape is
deliberately tiny:
``{code, message, details}``; consumers extend it (e.g., adding
``request_id``) by subclassing ``ErrorEnvelope``.
