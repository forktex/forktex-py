"""Lightweight background-job queue (arq-backed, Redis-native).

Fire-and-forget work that isn't durable — use ``flow`` for durable execution
with replay, state, and guaranteed delivery. ``queue`` is for work where
at-least-once delivery via Redis is sufficient and overhead matters.

arq chosen over celery/dramatiq: native asyncio, Redis already bundled as a
core dependency, minimal runtime overhead.
