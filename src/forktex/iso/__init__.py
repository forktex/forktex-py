"""Canonical ISO-8601 date/time handling for ForkTex Python services.

Zero extra dependencies — stdlib only. The one place that decides how a
datetime becomes text and back: always UTC, always ``datetime.isoformat()``'s
default precision/offset shape (``+00:00``, microseconds only when nonzero).
A naive input is assumed to already be UTC rather than raising, since that's
the shape every existing caller in this codebase already relied on before
this module existed — it isn't a new leniency being introduced. Pass
``strict=True`` to ``to_iso()``/``from_iso()`` to raise on naive input
instead — useful for a caller with no such existing assumption to preserve
(e.g. an external consumer of this library).

``log`` (JSON timestamps), ``grid`` (canonical stored/indexed temporal text),
``flow`` (pagination cursors, retry timestamps), and ``database`` (JSON-column
datetime fields) all delegate here instead of each hand-rolling the same
UTC-normalization dance — before this module existed they had drifted (some
forced UTC, some didn't; none agreed on precision).

    from forktex.iso import now, to_iso, from_iso

    now()                          # datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    to_iso(now())                  # "2026-08-12T10:30:00.123456+00:00"
    from_iso("2026-08-12T10:30:00+00:00")  # naive input is assumed UTC too

Argument errors here are stdlib ``TypeError``/``ValueError``, not ``AppError``
subclasses — a deliberate, recorded exception to this library's error contract.
``forktex.error`` imports ``forktex.types``, which imports this module, so an
``iso -> error`` edge would close a cycle between three level-0 primitives. The
alternative (moving ``ErrorEnvelope`` or ``UtcDateTime`` to break it) restructures
two primitives to retype three argument guards, and ``error-envelope.md`` scopes
its rule to errors that cross a transport boundary — which these do not: every one
signals a caller passing the wrong *type*, catchable as the builtin any Python
caller already expects.
