"""Level-1 ``[graph]`` extra — pure-Python multi-edge typed-graph algebra.

A generic in-memory graph primitive consumers compose into bigger
substrates. ``GraphNode`` / ``GraphEdge`` carry a free-form ``kind: str``
so each consumer brings its own vocabulary (forktex-py[graph] uses
``project_root``/``module``/``contains``; an intelligence consumer can
use ``person``/``account``/``works_at``). Multi-edge by construction:
edges with the same kind, endpoints, and attrs collapse; differ on any
of those three and they coexist between the same pair of nodes.

What ships:
  - ``GraphNode`` / ``GraphEdge`` / ``Graph`` Pydantic models.
  - Deterministic edge IDs via blake2s over (kind, src, dst, attrs).
  - O(1) lazy adjacency (out_edges / in_edges / neighbors).
  - Algorithms: BFS, DFS, transitive closure, shortest path, cycle detection.
  - Subgraph extract / induce.
  - Deterministic JSON serialisation (sorted), parse round-trip.

What does NOT ship:
  - Persistence. This is an in-memory algebra; persist the result yourself.
  - Cypher / SPARQL / DSL parsing. Out of scope.
  - Backends. Tomorrow Neo4j/dgraph adapters land as peer extras; today
    this is in-memory only. The user-facing API stays stable.
