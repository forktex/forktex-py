"""Level-0 ``[types]`` extra — base Pydantic models + frozen value objects.

The wire-shape opinion lives in ``BaseAppModel`` (snake↔camel). The
domain-shape opinion lives in ``BaseValueObject`` (frozen, hashable,
equality on values not identity). Together they cover the two model
shapes consumer code hits hardest:

  - cross-boundary payloads → ``BaseAppModel``
  - immutable in-process values (UUIDs, currency amounts, percentages,
    timestamps) → ``BaseValueObject``

This is a Level-0 primitive: it depends only on ``forktex.iso`` (for
``UtcDateTime``'s canonical UTC serialization) — a Level-0 sibling, not a
facade or substrate module, same as ``forktex.log``'s dependency on
``iso``. Specific value types (``Currency``, ``Percentage``, etc.) ship as
separate modules under ``forktex.types.*`` once they're consolidated
from consumer code.

``flow``'s cursors, ``database``'s JSON columns), all of which go through

and Pydantic's own validator already rejects a ``datetime`` with a nonzero
time component passed where a ``date`` is expected), so ``UtcDate`` exists
for naming symmetry and consistency with ``UtcDateTime`` rather than to

    shared (aliased) across instances despite ``frozen=True``. Prefer
