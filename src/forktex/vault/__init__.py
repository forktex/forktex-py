"""Symmetric encryption for credential blobs at rest.

Fernet-based (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256). There's no envelope encryption —
no separate data-encryption-key wrapped by the KEK — so KEK rotation fully
decrypts each payload with the old key and re-encrypts it with the new one.
``rotate_kek`` is O(1) per call, but a full rotation is a bulk migration
over every encrypted row, not an O(1) key-swap.

    vault = Vault(kek=os.environ["FORKTEX_KEK"])
    blob = vault.encrypt({"api_key": "sk-..."})   # → bytes
    data = vault.decrypt(blob)                     # → {"api_key": "sk-..."}

    # Rotate to a new master key (returns re-wrapped blob)
    new_blob = vault.rotate_kek(new_kek, blob)
