"""Top-level session-scoped testcontainer fixtures for the full core-py suite.

All containers are started once per pytest session and shared across test
modules to avoid Docker pull + startup overhead on every file. Per-test
isolation is achieved at the schema/key/collection level, not the container.

Container bring-up lives in :mod:`tests._containers` so the example
sandbox (``scripts/run_examples.py``) can boot the same set without
duplicating logic. Pytest fixtures here are thin wrappers.
