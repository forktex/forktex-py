"""The camelCase-on-the-wire promise has to hold for a plain `model_dump()`.

`BaseAppModel` documents "snake_case in Python, camelCase on the wire", but the
alias generator alone only applies aliases when a caller passes `by_alias=True`.
Every call site that forgot emitted snake_case and contradicted the error
envelope travelling on the same connection, so `serialize_by_alias` is now part
of the config and this pins it.
