"""STORY: an `[api]` consumer raises an `AppError`; the standard
envelope renders + the structured JSON log record carries the
request-id and error code.

Cross-module story for ``[api]`` + ``[error]`` + ``[log]``. Real
FastAPI app via ``create_app``; in-memory log capture via a custom
``logging.Handler`` so we can assert on the JSON shape without
touching stdout.

  Act 1. Build an app via ``create_app(AppConfig)`` with one happy
         route and one route that raises ``NotFoundError``. Attach a
         JSON-capturing log handler that mirrors what ``setup_logging``
         would emit to stdout.
  Act 2. Hit the happy route; assert the response carries
         ``X-Request-ID`` and the structured log record for the handler
         carries the same id.
  Act 3. Hit the error route; assert the response envelope shape is
         ``{code, message, details}``, the status code matches
         ``NotFoundError.http_status``, and the route's log record
         records the error code + the same request-id.
  Act 4. Confirm separate requests get distinct request-ids and the
         log handler can correlate logs back to each request.
