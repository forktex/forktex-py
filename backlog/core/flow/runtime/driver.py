"""Driver loop — leader-elected dispatcher for runs.

One driver per ``Flow`` instance. Each ``Flow`` competes for a
session-scoped Postgres advisory lock; only the holder runs ticks.
On lock loss (process death drops the connection → lock auto-
released), another worker grabs the lock on its next attempt.

The tick:
  1. Reclaim stale steps (heartbeat older than threshold).
  2. Claim up to N pending runs, mark each ``running``.
  3. Dispatch each via ``replay.execute_run`` as a coroutine.

Concurrency: many runs can execute concurrently inside one leader
worker — they're async coroutines, bounded only by the worker's
event loop. Throughput per leader is ~hundreds of in-flight runs
(I/O-bound). For higher throughput, multiple leaders would need a
sharded lock scheme; documented YAGNI for V1.
