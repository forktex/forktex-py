"""Replay-on-resume core: workflow execution + step durability wrapper.

The contract — the same one DBOS / Temporal / Restate use — is:
- A workflow function is called from the top each time the run is
  picked up by the driver (initial run or post-crash resume).
- Step calls inside the workflow route through ``dispatch_step``.
  ``dispatch_step`` checks ``step_run`` for a completed cache entry
  matching ``(run_id, step_qualname, args_hash)``; if found, returns
  the cached output (no re-run, no side effects). If not, dispatches
  the step body and records the result.
- A step that raises propagates to the workflow boundary; the run is
  marked ``failed`` after retries exhaust.

The current workflow's :class:`Ctx` is published on a
``ContextVar`` so step decorators (which can't take ``ctx`` from a
workflow-level closure) can pick it up during dispatch.
