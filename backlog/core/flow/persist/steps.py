"""Reads and writes on ``forktex_flow.step_run`` — the durable step-attempt table.

A step row is the unit replay keys off: `upsert_pending_step` is the idempotence boundary
(same run + qualname + args hash returns the cached outcome), and the `mark_step_*`
transitions record what happened. Stale-attempt reclaim compares against the **database**
clock, never the worker's, so a skewed worker cannot reclaim live work.
