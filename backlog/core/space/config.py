"""Configuration records for a Bundle.

The Bundle's job is to centralise rich-content config so multiple Grids
in the same bundle share defaults. A field-level setting always wins
over a Bundle-level default — Bundle defaults provide a sensible base,
not a hard ceiling.

- ``none`` — no embedding stored (the field accepts a free-form value

- ``inline`` — embedding stored in the row's JSONB payload (small
  vectors, < ~256 dims).
- ``remote`` — embedding stored in the vector store ([vector] →
  qdrant); the cell carries only a back-reference (collection name +
  point id).
- ``both`` — embedding written to both locations (consistency at the
  cost of write amplification; useful during a vector-store migration).
