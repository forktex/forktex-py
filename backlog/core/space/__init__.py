"""Level-2 ``[space]`` extra — multi-Grid bundle with shared rich-content config.

A ``Bundle`` is the wrapper between ``[grid]`` and rich content
(VECTOR / FILE field types) plus cross-Grid traversal. Consumers
that need only tabular state stay on bare ``Grid``; consumers that
add VECTOR or FILE fields graduate to ``Bundle`` to centralise
backing-service config (vector collection prefix, storage bucket,
embedding model defaults).

This module ships the ``Bundle`` facade, ``BundleConfig`` shared-config
record, and ``SyncSourceConfig`` contract for consumer-defined sync
drivers. VECTOR / FILE handlers and cross-Grid traversal helpers
lazy-import ``[vector]`` / ``[storage]`` / ``[graph]`` so consumers
only pay for what they use.
"""

# Side-effect: register rich FILE/VECTOR handlers into [grid]'s registry.
# Consumers that import [space] opt in to the rich behavior; pure-tabular
# consumers using only [grid] keep the bare handlers.
