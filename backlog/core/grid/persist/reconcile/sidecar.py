"""Promoted columns — materialise a virtual column into a real physical column.

The grid stores every logical table's rows in one shared ``grid_row`` JSONB
table, so a promoted column cannot become a native column *on* ``grid_row``
(that would leak into every table). Instead each logical table gets its own
**sidecar table** ``grid_promoted_<hash>`` keyed 1:1 to ``grid_row`` by row id,
with one native, correctly-typed column per promoted column.

Payload stays the source of truth; the sidecar is a maintained projection (the
same pattern as ``ref`` → ``grid_edge``). Promotion buys you real physical
columns: native ``UNIQUE`` / ``NOT NULL`` constraints, native indexes, and a
first-class target for external SQL, BI tools, or native foreign keys.

``reconcile_table_promoted`` creates/extends the sidecar (+ backfills existing
rows); the write path calls :func:`sync_promoted` to keep it in step. Temporal
types (``date``/``datetime``) are stored as canonical ISO text and are not
promotable (their ``text::date`` cast is not immutable); ``json`` / ``ref`` /
``derived`` are non-scalar and also excluded — see
:func:`forktex_core.grid.domain.fieldtypes.is_promotable`.

The sidecar's shape is per-table and known only at runtime, which is why this
used to be hand-built SQL. It is expressed instead as a Core ``Table`` assembled
on the fly (:func:`_sidecar_table`) and driven through
:mod:`forktex_core.database.ddl` / ``postgresql.insert``: identifiers are then
quoted by the dialect's preparer rather than by f-strings, and payload values
bind through their column's type instead of a hand-written ``CAST``.
